### Challenges I faced when working with Marvel API 
- Images not working on some devices because it returns as HTTP -> the solution is to convert it as HTTPS or use one of these [solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45940861/android-8-cleartext-http-traffic-not-permitted) 
- I got 401 Error with no reasons I did everything as documentation said but finally the solution was just to add * in my account authorized referrers
